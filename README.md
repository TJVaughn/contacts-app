# Contacts App

* Ruby version: ruby-2.7.1

* System dependencies: Gemfile

I created this as part of the [Learn Ruby on Rails - Full Course](https://youtu.be/fmyvWz5TUWg) YouTube video on FreeCodeCamp by John Elder.

I've worked with rails in the past but not for some time. This was a good intro project that taught me the ease of building simple web apps with lots of useful funcitonality quickly and easily using Rails. I am curious to learn much much more about rails and using it to build powerful web apps.

I also used Bootstrap 5 in this app for quick and easy styling, as doing all that css from scratch isn't a challenge, but takes a while.
